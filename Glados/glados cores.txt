glados

requires common function for extra menu text

types of modules/cores:
+	memory info - gives information about itself including where it is in memory
			gives bits of program info
				number of modules loaded
+	raw data storage and retrieval - will allow allocating a specific size amount of memory and storing data in said location
					another module will have a pointer that isn't set on init that if free'd will cause bug
+	cave johnson core
		cave johnson quotes - stored in a data array core
		menu for changing and interacting with cores
		attempts to link modules/portals (define this)
		likes to try random combinations of portals/modules with random data, probably a bad thing
+	glados core
		glados quotes - stored in a data array core
		menu for changing cores
		decides after x interactions or random (lower chance than cave johnson) to just terminate connection
+	random number generator core
+	controlled buffer overflow test core
		can't be uncontrolled as even the stack cookie wouldn't be good enough with data array core memory leaks
		could possibly be uncontrolled if 2nd cookie forced in place and adapted off of rdtsc or similar (something unguessable)
		but this results in brute forcing
+	data array core
		an array of data to be accessible
		cave johnson quotes stored in such a core
		allow up to 8 bytes per entry to be stored, does not do actual memory handling
		allow bug for improper indexing when reading ( < 0 indexing). Should allow discovery of binary location

modules are stored in a linked list, no bugs. maybe red herring of not resetting forward pointer properly but never used?
	see Khazad linked list bug for example
